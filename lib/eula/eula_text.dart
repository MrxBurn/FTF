This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a binding agreement between you ("User" or "you") and Fighter to Fighter ("FTF," "we," "us," or "our"). This Agreement governs your use of the FTF mobile application (the "App") and any related services provided by FTF.
1. Acceptance of Terms
By creating an account, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you may not access or use the App.
2. User-Generated Content
The App allows you to create, submit, post, display, and distribute content, including text and videos ("User Content"). You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it.
3. Prohibited Content
You agree not to post, upload, transmit, or otherwise make available any User Content that:
Is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, or discriminatory.
Violates the rights of others, including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights.
Contains software viruses or any other computer code designed to disrupt, damage, or limit the functionality of the App or any software or hardware.
Promotes any illegal activities or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory, or libelous.
4. User Conduct
You agree to use the App in a manner that is lawful, relevant, and proper. You will not:
Harass, abuse, or harm another person or group.
Impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.
Use the App for any unauthorized purpose or in violation of any applicable law.
Interfere with or disrupt the App or servers or networks connected to the App.
5. Content Moderation and Filtering
FTF employs automated content filtering tools to detect and block objectionable content before it is published. These tools are designed to identify and remove content that violates our Prohibited Content guidelines.
6. Reporting and Flagging Objectionable Content
If you encounter any objectionable content or abusive behavior, you can report it by using the "Flag" feature available within the App. All reports are reviewed by our moderation team, and appropriate action will be taken. FTF will act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content.
7. Blocking Abusive Users
You have the ability to block other users who engage in abusive or offensive behavior. Once a user is blocked, they will no longer be able to contact or view your profile.
8. Monitoring and Enforcement
We reserve the right to:
Remove or refuse to post any User Content for any reason.
Take any action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate, including if we believe that such User Content violates this Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right, threatens the personal safety of users of the App or the public, or could create liability for FTF.
Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the App for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of this Agreement.
9. Termination
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account and access to the App at our sole discretion, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates this Agreement or is harmful to other users of the App, us, or third parties, or for any other reason.
10. Changes to this Agreement
We may modify this Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Agreement on our website or through the App. Your continued use of the App after the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
